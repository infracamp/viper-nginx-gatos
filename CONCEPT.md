# Concept of Rudl-Manager

- No passwords needed for setup and configuration
- Configuration by repository


## Draft

The Manager container needs no Environment Variables. It can be configured calling

```
docker run -it infracamp/rudl-manager setup
```



It will then generate a ssh key and display it to you.
